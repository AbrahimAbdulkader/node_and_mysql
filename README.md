1st Commit - Test


2nd Commit - Test


3rd Commit - Installed the Faker package 


4th Commit - Required the Faker function and used some functions such as (email, past and city)


5th Commit - Installed the MySQL package connection, connected it and coded a few queries


6th Commit - Created a users table in the schema.sql file


7th Commit -  Called a query to print the total number of users in the users table


8th Commit - Testing insertion of 1 through NodeJS using MySQl


9th Commit - Inserted another user using different syntax and used the faker package to insert a fake email.
Also when it comes to date formatting in NodeJS it differs from MySQL syntax so luckly, NodeJS
is able to translate the code to where MySQL would be able to understand it and store it in MySQL formatted syntax



10th Commit - Inserted 500 users using an array and a loop that are randomly generated using the Faker package 
and storing the data in the users table.
